# Python To-Do List App (Command Line)

A beginner-friendly Python script that lets you manage a simple To-Do List directly in your terminal.  
You can **add tasks**, **view tasks**, **mark them as done**, and **delete tasks**.  
All your tasks are saved in one text file (`tasks.txt`), so they stay there even after you close the program.
